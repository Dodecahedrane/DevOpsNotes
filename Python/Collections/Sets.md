1. **Unique Elements**: If you need to store a collection of elements where each element is unique and duplicates are not allowed, sets are the ideal choice. Sets automatically eliminate duplicate elements, which can simplify your code and ensure data integrity.
2. **Membership Testing**: Sets offer very efficient membership testing. Checking whether an element is present in a set is much faster than doing the same operation on a list or tuple, especially for large collections of data. This is because sets use hash tables internally to store elements.
3. **Set Operations**: Sets support various set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations can be performed efficiently on sets and can be useful in many applications, such as finding common elements between two collections or removing duplicates.
4. **Mathematical Operations**: Sets are particularly useful for tasks involving mathematical operations like finding unique elements, computing intersections, unions, and differences. If your program involves tasks similar to set theory operations, sets provide a natural and efficient way to implement them.
5. **Unordered Collection**: Sets are unordered collections, which means that the elements are not stored in any particular order. If the order of elements is not important for your use case, using a set can be more efficient compared to a list, where maintaining order requires additional overhead.

## Frozen Sets

Frozen sets operate exactly like a set but are immutable so are read-only once they have been created. 

```python
frozen_set = frozenset({"hello", "world"})
```

Frozen sets are hashable and immutable

## Add

Adds an element to the set.

```python
my_set.add('element')
```

## Update

Adds elements from a collection to the set.

```python
my_set.update(['element1', 'element2'])
```

## Remove

Removes a specified element from the set. Raises ``KeyError`` if the element is not present.

```python
my_set.remove('element')
```

## Discard

Removes a specified element from the set if it is present.

```python
my_set.discard('element')
```

## Pop

Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises ``KeyError`` if the set is empty.

```python
element = my_set.pop()
```

## Clear

Removes all elements from the set.

```python
my_set.clear()
```

## Union

Returns a new set with elements from the set and all others passed as arguments.

```python
new_set = my_set.union(other_set)
```

## Intersection

Returns a new set with elements that are common to the set and all others passed as arguments.

```python
common_set = my_set.intersection(other_set)
```

## Difference

Returns a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.

```python
diff_set = my_set.difference(other_set)
```

## Symmetric Difference

Returns a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.

```python
sym_diff_set = my_set.symmetric_difference(other_set)
```

## Subset

Checks if the set is a subset of another set.

```python
is_subset = my_set.issubset(other_set)
```

## Superset

Checks if the set is a superset of another set.

```python
is_superset = my_set.issuperset(other_set)
```

These are some of the common methods used with sets in Python.
