## What are the 4 TYPES/MODELS of Cloud?

[Red Dat: Types of Cloud Computing](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/public-cloud-vs-private-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud#:~:text=Why%20Red%20Hat%3F-,Overview,a%2DService%20(SaaS).)

- Private Cloud
	- Uses shared infrastructure
	- AWS EC2
- Public Cloud
	- Uses dedicated infrastructure rented from a provider
- Hybrid Cloud
	- Multiple environments acting as one 'cloud'
- Multicloud
	- Multiple Cloud Providers operating as one 'unit' through the use of orchestration

All multiclouds are hybrid clouds, not all hybrid clouds are multiclouds.

For example, Azure + On Premises = Hybrid but not Multi
## What are the different types of cloud service?

- Azure
- AWS
- GCP
- Digital Ocean
- Hetzner
- etc etc etc etc etc etc
## Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud? Specifically for a business.

Good for dynamic workloads where you can scale your infra for short periods of time to meet increased demand without having to have the expense of that infrastructure the other 364 days a year.

Less overhead, someone else manages the hardware, network connection, building and upkeep.

Not locked into a fix contract. (Eg, Leased on premises server, vs monthly billed cloud VM)
## What is OpEx vs CapEx?

OpEx = Operation Expense (recurring)
CapEx = Capital Expense (not recurring)
